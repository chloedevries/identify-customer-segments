Project 3 of Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course: use kmeans to create customer segments for a mail-order company

# Overview
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to complete the third project in Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course. For the project, I employed a kmeans clustering model to identify customer segments in the larger population of Germany and see which segments were overindexed in a mail order company's user base.

## Installation
This project uses the following python libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib

Jupyter notebook is also required.
